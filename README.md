# Physics-Engine-Workshop
This repository contains files for the Physics Engine Workshop at the Code211 Hackathon. 

### Steps

Start with with [`pinball_template.py`](https://github.com/FilipOsowski/Physics-Engine-Workshop/blob/master/pinball_template.py).

This workshop has three steps:
1. Spawn pinballs using the space bar.
2. Create the second paddle
3. Add bumpers

Each completed step has its own file (i.e. step 1 is complete in `pinball_1_ball.py`). **If you get stuck or lost, copy & paste from these files!**

The complete and documented version of this project is found in the `pinball_3_bumpers.py` file.
